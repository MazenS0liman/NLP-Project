# Milestone 1
## Introduction
The purpose of this milestone was to put us in a situation where we have to practically implement an NLP preprocessing pipeline for Arabic text that makes the raw data suitable for performing a number of analysis tasks. Over the course of this report, we will provide an overview of the analysis tasks that we performed and what the purpose of the said analysis task might be. Then, we will cover some of the analysis tasks we performed or attempted to perform. We will discuss if the results of said analysis tasks give us any useful insights, or do we need different circumstances to get more use out of these tasks, or if the results should be discarded altogether.

## Overview of Our Analysis
The Arabic language is fascinating when studied from a linguistic perspective. It is very dif-
ferent from most other languages and especially English. Therefore, when preprocessing Arabic
text, we have to take these differences into account and act accordingly. This can manifest in
some preprocessing steps that are not performed in other languages such as dediacritization,
as well as taking different dialects into account, especially if we are dealing with transcribed
spoken language. In this section, we will explore these steps in deeper detail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The goal of this analysis is to preprocess Arabic language transcript dataset of famous YouTuber ElDa7ee7 to be able to perform various analysis or regression tasks such as visualizing the most common expressions used by the YouTuber (through N-Grams) or regression tasks such as predicting the number of views or likes a video will get based on the transcript data such as length, category, sarcasm, ..etc.

# Milestone 2
## Introduction
The purpose of this milestone was to implement a shallow neural network for information retrieval and question-answering tasks. We used the SQuAD dataset. Which contains a context and a question with an answer and answer start index that can be used to retrieve the answer from the context.
